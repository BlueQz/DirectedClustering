## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. As suggested, in this version I have:

* Modified the DESCRIPTION field so that does not begin with "this package" or similar.

* Wrote package names and software names in single quotes in title and description.
(e.g. 'igraph' in description field).
 
* Enclosed the title "Directed clustering in weighted networks: a new perspective" in double quotes.

* Added blanks in example codes
* Provided a better description of examples
